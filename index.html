<h2>Why Play?</h2>
<p>Virs is an expansive world that combines many aspects of favorite realms in the D&D metaverse, such as Faerun and Eberron, with touches of inspiration from Magic: The Gathering's Innistrad and Ravnica.
    This amalagam of tone and flavor invites players to fully enjoy themselves in both roleplay and combat, the limits truly being left to your dungeon master and you! </p>
